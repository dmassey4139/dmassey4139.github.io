            When I considered purchasing a desktop I knew that I wanted 
            something I was able to game on meaning the specs had to be 
            decent. My original purchase was a Lenovo desktop with an 
            Intel Core i5-6400 processor, 8GB RAM, 1TB hard with an 8GB 
            solid state drive, and a NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 GPU. Since the 
            game I mostly play is League of Legends these specs were more 
            than enough to run the game at an efficient level. However, I 
            quickly found myself wanting to play more demanding games and 
            also wanted to be able to stream, meaning that I had to upgrade 
            some of my older parts. So far the upgrades I have made 
            include: my ram to 16GB, my Power Supply to a 750watt, 
            and my GPU to the NVIDIA GeForce 970. These alone give me more 
            than enough power to run just about any game a <img id="dylan_gaming_pic_1" src="./../media/dylan/dylan_gaming_pics/lenovo.jpg" alt="dylan_pic_1" /> want to at high 
            settings while also streaming. The next upgrades I plan to make 
            are to my motherboard, CPU and a new case.

            Other than the specs of the computer there are other peripheral 
            devices that help to give me a better gaming experience over 
            all. One the most important devices is the mouse; in which I 
            have chosen to use the Logitech G502 Proteus Spectrum RGB.
            This mouse comes with 11 programmable buttons, allowing you to 
            program multiple different macros that can give you an edge. On 
            top of that it also comes with 5 3.6gram weights that you can 
            choose to use which can make the mouse feel more comfortable to 
            <img id="dylan_gaming_pic_2" src="./../media/dylan/dylan_gaming_pics/rgb.png" alt="dylan_pic_2.jpg" />
            move around overall. Another very important peripheral device 
            that I use is my mechanical keyboard. The mechanical keyboard I 
            have chosen to use is the Razer Blackwidow Chroma. This keyboard
             was the very first mechanical gaming keyboard and helps to give
             a major advantage in gaming by utilizing mechanical switches 
            in its keys. These switches give the keyboard a boost in 
            accuracy and much better response time than your average 
            keyboard which is very important when trying to game at a 
            competitive level. I also have the Corsair VOID 7.1 wireless 
            headset so that I can communicate with my friends when we are 
            playing a game together. This allows for us to communicate in a 
            fashion that is much quicker than having to type everything out <img id="dylan_gaming_pic_3" src="./../media/dylan/dylan_gaming_pics/blackwidow.png" alt="dylan_pic_2.jpg" />
            on a keyboard.

            While I enjoy playing video games, I also like to stream them 
            when I am able to do so.
            The website I stream on is called Twtich.tv which is the 
            platform that a majority of the professional streamers use. 
            The capture software I use to set up my stream is called Open 
            Broadcast Software, which is free open source software that is 
            used for recording and live streaming. The design of this 
            software is very simple and made it very easy for me to set up 
            a nice layout and have my stream going in just a couple of hours. 
            Other than the software used, there are also other peripheral devices 
            that I use while streaming to in order to optimize the stream for 
            myself and my viewers. <img id="dylan_gaming_pic_4" src="./../media/dylan/dylan_gaming_pics/blue.png" alt="dylan_pic_4.jpg" /> 
            One of the devices I use is the Blue Yeti Microphone which 
            allows for me to talk and interact with my viewers. This helps 
            to keep my audience involved and makes the stream much more 
            entertaining than it would be if they were just watching me 
            play some game. Another device that I like to use is the 
            Logitech C920 HD Webcam. This allows for my viewers to actually 
            see me and the reactions I have while I am live. Allowing people 
            to see me and who I am can help to make them feel more 
            comfortable when interacting with me through the stream. 
            While I have not gotten too far into streaming, I am hoping that 
            I will be able to build up a decent sized fan base and have a 
            great time with it in the near future.
